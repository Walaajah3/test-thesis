## Open-Science-Paper

### About

The Open-Science-Paper
[repository](https://github.com/cpfaff/Open-Science-Paper) contains a LaTeX
document which is thought to be forked and used for scientific, collaborative
paper writing via GitHub. The document combines the typesetting capabilities of
LaTeX with the R programming language for statistics, using the
[Knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) package. This combination allows for the
production of executable documents that enhance the reproducibility of your
research.

The Open-Science-Paper offers a clean and logical folder structure and lots of
examples of typical typesetting requirements to help you typeset your paper. It
comes with a makefile that helps you to compile, clean and archive the
document.  The document layout is close to common scientific paper formats.
This layout can help you to prepare figures and tables for publication. But you
can also just use the Open-Science-Paper to produce nice looking, paper like
formatted documents. For an example see the PDF file inside of the repository
or have a look into the impressions section below.

The project is documented on detail in the Open-Science-Paper
[wiki](https://github.com/cpfaff/Open-Science-Paper/wiki). It covers
information about the prerequisites and how to get started with the document, a
workflow for collaborative paper writing on GitHub and much more.
