## About

### Open-Science-Thesis

The Open-Science-Thesis
[repository](https://github.com/cpfaff/Open-Science-Thesis) contains a LaTeX
document which is thought to be forked and used for scientific, writing via
GitHub. The document combines the typesetting capabilities of LaTeX with the R
programming language for statistics, using the [Knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/)
package. This combination allows for the production of executable documents that
enhance the reproducibility of your research.

The Open-Science-Thesis offers a clean and logical folder structure and lots of
examples of typical typesetting requirements to help you typeset your thesis. It
comes with a makefile that helps you to compile, clean and archive the document.
The document layout is specialized to typeset report or book formated documents.
For an example see the PDF file inside of the repository or have a look into the
impressions section below.

The project is documented on detail in the Open-Science-Thesis
[wiki](https://github.com/cpfaff/Open-Science-Thesis/wiki). It covers information
about the prerequisites and how to get started with the document, a workflow for
collaborative paper writing on GitHub and much more.
