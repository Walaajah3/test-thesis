## Open-Science-Thesis

### About

The Open-Science-Thesis
[repository](https://github.com/cpfaff/Open-Science-Thesis) contains a LaTeX
document which is thought to be forked and used for scientific thesis writing
via GitHub. The document combines the typesetting capabilities of LaTeX with
the R programming language for statistics, using the
[Knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) package. This combination allows for the
creation of executable documents that enhance the reproducibility of your
research.

The Open-Science-Thesis offers a clean and logical folder structure and lots of
examples of typical typesetting requirements to help you typeset your thesis.
It comes with a makefile that helps you to compile, clean and archive the
document. For an example see the PDF file inside of the repository or have a
look into the impressions section below.

### Development Note

This repository is still in development and the commands, environments and the
layout provided by the LaTeX class are subject to change. You might also find
the current version in master branch in unstable state so a compilation to PDF
is not possible!
